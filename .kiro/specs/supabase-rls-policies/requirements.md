# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FlipFlow application is experiencing database access issues due to missing or inadequate Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase. Users cannot fetch existing flipbooks or create new ones because the database is blocking these operations at the policy level. This feature will establish comprehensive RLS policies that ensure proper data access control while allowing authenticated users to perform necessary operations on their own data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view my own flipbooks, so that I can see all the flipbooks I have previously created in my dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user requests their flipbooks THEN the system SHALL return all flipbooks where the user_id matches the authenticated user's ID
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access flipbooks THEN the system SHALL deny access and return no data
3. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to view another user's flipbooks THEN the system SHALL deny access and return no data for those flipbooks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create new flipbooks, so that I can upload and manage my PDF content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user submits a new flipbook THEN the system SHALL allow the insert operation if the user_id matches the authenticated user's ID
2. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to create a flipbook with another user's ID THEN the system SHALL deny the operation
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to create a flipbook THEN the system SHALL deny the operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to update my own flipbooks, so that I can modify titles, descriptions, or other metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user updates a flipbook they own THEN the system SHALL allow the update operation
2. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to update a flipbook owned by another user THEN the system SHALL deny the operation
3. WHEN the update operation includes changing the user_id THEN the system SHALL deny the operation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to delete my own flipbooks, so that I can remove content I no longer need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user deletes a flipbook they own THEN the system SHALL allow the delete operation
2. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to delete a flipbook owned by another user THEN the system SHALL deny the operation
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to delete any flipbook THEN the system SHALL deny the operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to manage my profile information, so that my account details are properly maintained when creating flipbooks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user views their profile THEN the system SHALL return their profile data
2. WHEN an authenticated user creates or updates their profile THEN the system SHALL allow the operation if the profile ID matches the authenticated user's ID
3. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to access another user's profile THEN the system SHALL deny access
4. WHEN the flipbook creation process triggers a profile upsert THEN the system SHALL allow the operation for the authenticated user's profile

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to upload PDF files to storage, so that I can create flipbooks from my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL allow the upload to their designated storage path
2. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to upload to another user's storage path THEN the system SHALL deny the operation
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to upload files THEN the system SHALL deny the operation
4. WHEN an authenticated user accesses their uploaded files THEN the system SHALL allow read access to their own files only

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want RLS policies to be properly configured and documented, so that the security model is clear and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS policies are created THEN each policy SHALL have a clear, descriptive name indicating its purpose
2. WHEN policies are implemented THEN they SHALL follow the principle of least privilege
3. WHEN policies are deployed THEN they SHALL be accompanied by documentation explaining their purpose and scope
4. IF a policy needs to be modified THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration paths
