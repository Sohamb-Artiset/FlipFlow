# FlipFlow MVP Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

The core flipbook MVP functionality has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### üìÅ Core Files Created:
- `src/lib/pdfProcessor.ts` - PDF processing with PDF.js
- `src/lib/storage.ts` - Supabase Storage helper functions
- `src/components/FlipbookUpload.tsx` - Drag & drop PDF upload
- `src/components/FlipbookViewer.tsx` - Interactive flipbook viewer with react-pageflip
- `src/components/FlipbookCustomization.tsx` - Customization panel
- `src/pages/FlipbookView.tsx` - Public flipbook viewing page
- `src/pages/FlipbookEdit.tsx` - Flipbook editing page
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Updated dashboard with flipbook management
- `src/hooks/useFlipbookAnalytics.ts` - Analytics tracking
- `supabase/migrations/20250111000000_setup_storage_buckets.sql` - Storage setup

### üöÄ Features Implemented:
1. **PDF Upload & Processing** - Drag & drop interface with validation
2. **Interactive Flipbook Viewer** - Realistic page-flip animations with react-pageflip
3. **Basic Customization** - Title, description, background color, logo upload
4. **Public Sharing** - Shareable URLs for public flipbooks
5. **Analytics Tracking** - View counting and basic analytics
6. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly interface
7. **User Dashboard** - Manage flipbooks with CRUD operations

## üîß Manual Setup Required

### 1. PDF.js Worker Setup ‚úÖ
The PDF.js worker file has been copied to `public/pdf.worker.min.mjs` for local access. This resolves the CDN loading issues.

### 2. Supabase Storage Buckets
You need to manually create these storage buckets in your Supabase dashboard:

**Bucket 1: `flipbook-pdfs`**
- Public: Yes (public) - Required for flipbook viewing
- File size limit: 100MB
- Allowed MIME types: `application/pdf`

**Bucket 2: `flipbook-assets`**
- Public: Yes (public)
- File size limit: 5MB
- Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`, `image/svg+xml`

### 2. Storage Policies
Run the SQL from `supabase/migrations/20250111000000_setup_storage_buckets.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to set up the storage policies.

### 3. Supabase Type Generation
To ensure your frontend types always match your database schema, use the Supabase CLI to generate types automatically:

1. **Install Supabase CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

2. **Generate types from your database schema**:
   ```bash
   supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-id> > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
   ```

3. **Re-run this command** whenever you make changes to your database schema to keep types in sync.

**Note**: This replaces the manual `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` file with auto-generated types directly from your database, preventing type mismatches and maintenance errors.

### 4. Dependencies Installed
The following packages have been installed:
- `pdfjs-dist` - PDF rendering
- `react-pageflip` - Flipbook engine
- `framer-motion` - Animations
- `react-dropzone` - File upload
- `@types/pdfjs-dist` - TypeScript support

## üéØ How to Use

### For Users:
1. **Sign up/Login** - Use the existing auth system
2. **Upload PDF** - Click "Create Flipbook" in dashboard, drag & drop PDF
3. **Customize** - Edit title, description, colors, upload logo
4. **Share** - Get public URL to share your flipbook
5. **View Analytics** - See view counts in dashboard

### For Developers:
1. **Dashboard** - `/dashboard` - Manage flipbooks
2. **View Flipbook** - `/flipbook/:id` - Public viewing
3. **Edit Flipbook** - `/flipbook/:id/edit` - Customization
4. **Upload Component** - Reusable upload dialog

## üîç Technical Details

### PDF Processing:
- Client-side PDF rendering using PDF.js
- Converts PDF pages to canvas images
- Supports files up to 100MB
- Generates base64 image data for react-pageflip

### Storage:
- PDFs stored in private `flipbook-pdfs` bucket
- Assets (logos) stored in public `flipbook-assets` bucket
- Organized by user ID for security

### Analytics:
- Tracks page views with IP and user agent
- Increments view count atomically
- Provides basic statistics in dashboard

## üö® Known Limitations

1. **Large PDFs** - Very large PDFs (>50MB) may cause performance issues
2. **Mobile Performance** - Heavy PDFs may be slow on mobile devices
3. **Storage Costs** - PDF storage can be expensive for many users
4. **No Server-side Processing** - All PDF processing happens client-side

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

1. **Server-side PDF Processing** - Convert PDFs to images on upload
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Page-level analytics, engagement metrics
3. **Embedding** - iframe embed codes for websites
4. **Offline Downloads** - Self-contained HTML packages
5. **Team Collaboration** - Multiple users per flipbook
6. **Advanced Customization** - More branding options, themes

## üì± Testing

To test the MVP:
1. Create a Supabase account and set up the storage buckets
2. Run the migration SQL
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Sign up for an account
5. Upload a small PDF (< 10MB for testing)
6. Customize and share your flipbook

The MVP is now ready for user testing and feedback!
