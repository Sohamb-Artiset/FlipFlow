# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dashboard is experiencing significant performance issues with slow data fetching and loading screens that get stuck. Additionally, users are unable to sign out properly. This feature addresses critical performance bottlenecks and authentication flow issues to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to load quickly without getting stuck on loading screens, so that I can access my flipbooks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the dashboard THEN the flipbooks SHALL load within 3 seconds under normal network conditions
2. WHEN the dashboard is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states without infinite loading
3. WHEN there are network errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options
4. WHEN the user has no flipbooks THEN the system SHALL show the empty state immediately without unnecessary loading delays

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to sign out successfully from any page, so that I can securely end my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Sign Out" button THEN the system SHALL immediately clear the user session
2. WHEN sign out is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the home page or login page
3. WHEN sign out occurs THEN the system SHALL clear all cached user data and profile information
4. WHEN there are sign out errors THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication state to be managed efficiently, so that I don't experience unnecessary delays or multiple profile fetches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL fetch the profile data only once per session
2. WHEN the profile data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL not block other UI operations
3. WHEN profile creation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to default settings
4. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI reactively without full page reloads

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want database queries to be optimized, so that my dashboard loads quickly even with many flipbooks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching flipbooks THEN the system SHALL use efficient database queries with proper indexing
2. WHEN there are many flipbooks THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or lazy loading
3. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry logic
4. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL not refetch data unnecessarily if it's already cached
